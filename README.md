## Okay, so I think I owe an advertisement.

If you're confident in your Korean, and want to learn web dev with a _faaaancy_ project, check out [Sparta Coding Club](https://spartacodingclub.kr/?f_name=%EA%B9%80%EC%97%B0%EC%9B%85&f_uid=620791f3fdd3093904334898)! I made this website just by following [a one-hour tutorial on making a "deokdam" (kind words) sharing page](https://spartacodingclub.kr/online/special/deokdam) which went free during the Chinese New Year. Doesn't matter whether you've got previous experience in coding, they give down-to-earth explanations, assets, code, server space, everything! If you can spare an hour, you can make your own deokdam page with this free course! (The sale's probably off by now and it'll cost you like eighty bucks tho)
